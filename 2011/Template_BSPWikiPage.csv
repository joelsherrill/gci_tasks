"Create BSP Wiki Page for @BSPNAME@","RTEMS uses a <a href=""http://www.mediawiki.org/"">Mediawiki</a> installation for its <a href=""http://www.rtems.org/wiki"">wiki</a>.  Each embedded board supported by RTEMS is supposed to have its own wiki page.  There is an Infobox on the upper right hand side of each BSP wiki page.  Some BSPs do not have BSP pages and even those that do have pages created do not always have a completed Infobox.  This is because we learned how to implement the Infoboxes after the pages were added, most of them are just stubs.  The Infobox template is <a href=""http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/Template:Infobox_BSP"">here</a> and is the complete view of the fields available.  A reasonably good example of a filled in Infobox is the <a href=""http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/BF537Stamp"">Blackfin BF537 Stamp BSP</a> page.  This task consists of finding the vendor specification of the @BSPNAME@ board, which is publicly available and filling in the Infobox and other information at the <a href=""http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/@WIKINAME@"">@BSPNAME@ BSP page</a>.  You should check this BSP has an entry in the <a href=""http://wiki.rtems.com/wiki/index.php/BoardSupportPackageInformation"">BSP master list</a> and add this if missing.  Please be careful in making sure all possible fields in the Infobox are filled in correctly",72,"@MENTOR@","Easy","Documentation","Wiki"
