Prerequisite: Being able to build RTEMS Documentation

The POSIX Users Guide has sections where the prototype of the method
is missing. This is because the current contents for that service are
a stub.  The following is an example from
posix_users/device_and_class_specific.rst:

.. code-block:: c

    int tcgetpgrp(
    );

This task consists of finding all methods in the .rst file specific to your
instance of the task, locating all places where a method is incompletely
prototyped, finding the correct prototype, fixing the document, and submitting
a patch. The correct prototype can be found in the Open Group POSIX specification
at http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/

For the above example, the correct prototype you would end up with should be:

.. code-block:: c

    #include <unistd.h>
    pid_t tcgetpgrp(int fildes);

This task can be instanced for the following files:
