CX is POSIX 2013 notation for extensions to the C Programming
Language Standard. Sometimes it is for functionality and other
times it is to add a method.

This task consists of identifying the .h files which have
CX methods and any rules defined for adding them. This
will usually be something like "added in POSIX 2003" or
a more complex list of standards. This information will
be used in a subsequent tasks to verify the proper CPP
macro guards.

Header files are either in RTEMS, Newlib, or not supported.
The script will ignore the not supported ones.
