sp09 split up. It is too long, too big, and uses a mix of every
manager. The test is set up in screens which really correspond to a
screen of output on a VT-100.  That's how we checked the tests in the
original lab.  A "range" of the test is for a single manager. The tasks
would likely have to start at the end.


    + screen 14 -> sptimer_err01 and sptimer_err02
    + screen 13 -> spclock_err01 and spio_err01
    + screen 12 -> spregion_err01
    + screen 11 -> sppartition_err01
    + screen 10 -> spratemon_err01
    + screen 9  -> spport_err01, spsignal_err01, and spintr_err01
       ...

until test is dispersed. I would expect that the configuration of the
test shrinks along the way until sp09 is gone.
