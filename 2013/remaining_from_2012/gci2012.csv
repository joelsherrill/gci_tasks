Test Coverage Report Improvements #1,"<p>This task consists of modifying the existing Bourne shell script that generates the primary table of results per target. An example of this can be found in the erc32 coverage results at <a href=""http://www.rtems.org/ftp/pub/rtems/people/joel/coverage/erc32.html#OsPD"" title=""http://www.rtems.org/ftp/pub/rtems/people/joel/coverage/erc32.html#OsPD"">http://www.rtems.org/ftp/pub/rtems/people/joel/coverage/erc32.html#OsPD</a>.</p>
<p>This is a task which is a step in a multiple step project. </p>
<p>Break out the current one page per target with a section per test configuration with a table into separate pages. The top level table will consist only of links to a set of pages per test configuration. The new pages will consist of the table. The plotted data of multiple test configurations should be removed. Instead each ""per test configuration"" page should include a plot of the data ONLY for that configuration.</p>
<p>The scripts are in the rtems-testing git module. You will need to be familiar with git and Bourne Shell programming. Ask for sample data to use when working on this task. You will not need to run our test suite -- just generate reports based on their output.</p>

Identify new microprocessor architectures appropriate for RTEMS #1,"<p>Although most computer users are only familiar with the x86, PowerPC (Mac), and ARM (phones, etc.), there are at least a dozen other microprocessor architectures used in embedded systems.

If it is feasible, look at the features of the architecture that would be important to the person porting RTEMS to this architecture.</p>
<p>To get started, some ideas for architectures can be found at:http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/trunk/libgcc/config/</p>
<p>Additional architectures can be found at: http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/opcodes/?cvsroot=src and http://opencores.org/projects</p>
