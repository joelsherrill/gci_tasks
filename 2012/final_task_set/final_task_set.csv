7961205,Create RTEMS Project Wiki Page for ESA GAIA Mission,RTEMS Project,Outreach/Research,flyer,2 days,Sebastian Huber,The RTEMS Project has a number of flyers at http://www.rtems.org/flyers.html which provide some details on various projects which have used RTEMS.  Each of these flyers is based upon a Wiki page about that project with the same or similar text and pictures.  This task consists of preparing a wiki page on an RTEMS application which consists of approximately one to two pages of text plus 2 or more nice pictures or figures about the project and a few URLs of reference for more details.  The information on the flyers is based on this and is presented in a very uniform manner. The Wiki page is easier to edit and review collaboratively. We will create the flyer from the information on the Wiki page you create. Most of the information you need should be available from public sources on the Internet. When you take this task you may be given an email address of a contact for that project to obtain information from.  The wiki page you will create is for the ESA GAIA Mission. More details about this project and some hints for searching and creating content may be found at http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/GoogleCodeInProjects#Info_for_flyers_for_various_projects_using_RTEMS,Mat,Joel Sherrill,Joel Sherrill,2012-11-25 18:15:58,2012-11-25 18:15:58,2012-11-29 00:45:48,Closed,/gci/task/edit/google/gci2012/7961205

8001208,Create RTEMS Project Wiki Page for ESA Exomars Mission,RTEMS Project,Outreach/Research,flyer,2 days,Muhammad Adnan,The RTEMS Project has a number of flyers at http://www.rtems.org/flyers.html which provide some details on various projects which have used RTEMS.  Each of these flyers is based upon a Wiki page about that project with the same or similar text and pictures.  This task consists of preparing a wiki page on an RTEMS application which consists of approximately one to two pages of text plus 2 or more nice pictures or figures about the project and a few URLs of reference for more details.  The information on the flyers is based on this and is presented in a very uniform manner. The Wiki page is easier to edit and review collaboratively. We will create the flyer from the information on the Wiki page you create. Most of the information you need should be available from public sources on the Internet.

8180209,Identify new microprocessor architectures appropriate for RTEMS #2,RTEMS Project,Outreach/Research,microprocessor architecture,3 days,Joel Sherrill,"<div class=""block-task-description"">
<p>Although most computer users are only familiar with the x86, PowerPC (Mac), and ARM (phones, etc.), there are at least a dozen other microprocessor architectures used in embedded systems. Identify one which RTEMS is not available for and determine if it is feasible to port RTEMS to it. If it is not feasible, identify why. If it is feasible, look at the features of the architecture that would be important to the person porting RTEMS to this architecture.</p>
<p>To get started, some ideas for architectures can be found at:http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/trunk/libgcc/config/</p>
<p>Additional architectures can be found at: http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/opcodes/?cvsroot=src and http://opencores.org/projects</p>
<p>Although RTEMS has been ported to Xilinx, other FPGA manufacturers can be found in: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array#Major_manufacturers</p>
<p>If you know of an architecture that isn't on either list, please propose it anyway!</p>

<p>RTEMS Toolkits - We are defining collections of libraries and support programs which make it easier to get started for certain types of applications. Each potential component must be evaluated for license and appropriateness for use in an embedded environment like RTEMS. If the software is determined to have an appropriate license, written in a language that the RTEMS compiler supports, and doesn't have too many dependencies, we embed the software into RTEMS and the end user has functionality that is already documented and maintained. For example the RTEMS configuration kit enables an end-user to easily write a configuration parser that is well-documented.</p>

<p>RTEMS Toolkits - We are defining collections of libraries and support programs which make it easier to get started for certain types of applications. Each potential component must be evaluated for license and appropriateness for use in an embedded environment like RTEMS. If the software is determined to have an appropriate license, written in a language that the RTEMS compiler supports, and doesn't have too many dependencies, we embed the software into RTEMS and the end user has functionality that is already documented and maintained. For example the RTEMS configuration kit enables an end-user to easily write a configuration parser that is well-documented.</p>
<p>The task consists of taking the proposed software package within the kit and determining the last date each package was modified. To complete this task submit a .txt (or edit the toolkit page directly) with the date the package was last modified.</p>
