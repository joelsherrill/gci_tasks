Create RTEMS Project Wiki Page for ESA Proba-V Mission, The RTEMS Project has a number of <a href=""http://www.rtems.org/flyers.html"">flyers</a> which provide some details on various projects which have used RTEMS.  Each of these flyers is based upon a Wiki page about that project with the same or similar text and pictures.  This task consists of preparing a wiki page on an RTEMS application which consists of approximately one to two pages of text plus 2 or more nice pictures or figures about the project and a few URLs of reference for more details.  The information on the flyers is based on this and is presented in a very uniform manner. The Wiki page is easier to edit and review collaboratively. We will create the flyer from the information on the Wiki page you create. Most of the information you need should be available from public sources on the Internet. When you take this task you may be given an email address of a contact for that project to obtain information from.  The wiki page you will create is for the ESA Proba-V Mission. More details about this project and some hints for searching and creating content may be found on this <a href=""http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/GoogleCodeInProjects#Info_for_flyers_for_various_projects_using_RTEMS"">wiki page</a>, 48, joel_sherrill, Outreach/Research, flyer"," wiki
